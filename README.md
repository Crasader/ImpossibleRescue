##**Overview**
**Impossible Rescue** is a 2D single-screen platformer game, inspired by Manic Miner, Impossible Mission, and Shadow Complex Remastered. The game follows a freelance mercenary, ‘Danielle’, and her remote AI assistant <abbr title="Specialist Hard-linked Android for Duty in Offshore Wars">'S.H.A.D.O.W.'</abbr>, on a mission to rescue the President of Earth's daughter from a hidden security installation on Mars. The player must take control of Danielle in order to navigate a series of single-screen, theme-based environments, interacting with various platforms, avoiding/destroying enemies and 'hacking' computers in order to progress from one area to the next. The game was developed by a team of 10 people, consisting of 3 programmers, 3 artists, 2 designers, a producer and a music composer.  The game was built using C++ and the Gamer Camp [GCFramework](https://bitbucket.org/darbotron/gcframework/src/master/ "GCFramework"); a wrapper around Cocos2d-x. The game runs on a PC, with the use of a Dualshock 4 controller. A video demo can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fUhpNCXA-GPNHENtkok3PveHw8dyuWJH "here").
